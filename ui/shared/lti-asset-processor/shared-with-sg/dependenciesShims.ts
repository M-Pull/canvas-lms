/**
 * Most of the ltiAssetProcessor code, which provides LTI Asset Reports, is
 * duplicated in SpeedGrader. The replicated/ directory should be kept identical to
 * the code in canvas-lms by making the changes in here or in Canvas and using
 * the asset-processor-speedgrader-sync script to copy the changed files to the other place
 * and run linting.
 *
 * This file provides dependencies used by the shared code which need to be
 * different between Canvas and this repo.
 *
 * Generally, SpeedGrader coding linting standards are stricter, so it may be
 * easiest to make changes in the SpeedGrader repo and copy them to Canvas.
 *
 * You can use the asset-processors-code-copy script in interop-team-scripts
 * to easily copy the replicated directory from one repo to another (and patch
 * the I18n import, see script for details)
 *
 * See also canvas-lms/doc/lti/18_asset_reports.md
